# Stickers

This is a messy folder full of the designs I've used for my stickers. I have plans to organize this, but for now it's a mess. If someone wants to take a stab at putting them in folders, be my guest!


## Attribution

Most of these designs are from [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com) with the exception of the "Never Stop Learning" 70's design, which was done by the talented [Kyle Gallant](https://twitter.com/Eckstatic)

You are welcome to use these designs as you please - print your own, use the graphics on your blog, or put them on tshirts. 

Most of the designs are done in Sketch, which is not really a good tool for designing print, but  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

A link back to any of my stuff is appreciated but I realize you can't always do that. 


## Buying these stickers

I sell them on the site [Bos.af](https://bos.af/). They are sold out right now but I will have more in October.

## Printer Hookups - Where should you get these printed?
TODO

Have fun!
